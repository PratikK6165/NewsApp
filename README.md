  Fetching News: The app fetches news articles from the News API using Volley. The news is displayed in a RecyclerView in the News fragment.
  Bookmarking: When a user taps the bookmark icon on an article, it gets saved to a local SQLite database. Bookmarked articles are displayed in the Bookmarks fragment.
  Detailed News View: Clicking on any article from the News or Bookmark list shows a detailed view of the article.
